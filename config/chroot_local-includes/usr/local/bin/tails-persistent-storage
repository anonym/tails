# If this script is run as amnesia, re-run it as the
# tails-persistent-storage user, which is allowed to connect to the tps
# D-Bus service on the system bus. We use the `tails-persistent-storage`
# user instead of root to avoid authentication to D-Bus as root, which
# would allow accessing all kinds of privileged D-Bus services.
#
# Before elevating privileges, we store the current environment in a
# file, so that we can pass it to the tps-frontend process below without
# having to configure sudo to preserve the environment when elevating
# and dropping privileges.
#
# See also the corresponding sudoers policies in
# config/chroot_local-includes/etc/sudoers.d/zzz_tps.

# Explanation of the following command:
#
# 1. `/usr/local/lib/connect-socket --dbus-system-bus` opens the D-Bus socket and
#    authenticates to it as the tails-persistent-storage user.
#
# 2. `sudo --close-from=4 -u amnesia` drops privileges to the amnesia
#    user and closes all file descriptors greater than 3, with 3 being
#    the opened D-Bus socket. This way we should avoid inadvertently
#    having the unprivileged tps-frontend process inherit any other file
#    descriptors opened as a privileged user.
#
# 3. `/usr/local/lib/run-with-env` reads the environment from
#    the file we created above and passes the allowed environment
#    variables to the tps-frontend process (see
#    config/chroot_local-includes/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/tailslib/userenv.py
#    for the list of allowed variables).
#
# 4. `/usr/local/lib/tps-frontend` starts the actual tps-frontend app.
