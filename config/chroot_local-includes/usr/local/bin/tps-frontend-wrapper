# To avoid authenticating to D-Bus as root (which would allow accessing
# all kinds of privileged D-Bus services), we authenticate as another
# user, tails-persistent-storage, whose only privilege is that it's
# allowed to connect to the tails-persistent-storage D-Bus service.
#
# After opening the D-Bus socket and authenticating, connect-drop
# executes /usr/local/lib/tps-frontend as amnesia, closing all
# file descriptors greater than 3, with 3 being the opened D-Bus
# socket. This way we should avoid inadvertently the unprivileged
# tps-frontend process inheriting any other file descriptors opened
# as a privileged user.
#
# See also the corresponding sudoers policies in
# config/chroot_local-includes/etc/sudoers.d/zzz_tps-frontend.
