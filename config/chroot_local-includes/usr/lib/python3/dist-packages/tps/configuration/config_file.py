    The format is compatible with the persistence.conf file of

    * Each line must contain a "source" option
    * The only other option that is supported is the "link" option.
      Specifying the default "bind" option explicitly is not
      supported and the "union" option is also unsupported.

    We only support writing the full config file with all currently
    enabled features.
    We can not easily support adding / deleting the lines of a
    a specific feature or list of features, because that would
    cause the config file to be broken if any two features have the
    same binding. In that case, we would not be able to tell which
    feature a specific line in the config file belongs to, so
    it's not clear which lines should be removed on feature
    deactivation.
