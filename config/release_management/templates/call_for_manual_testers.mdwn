Subject: Testing Tails {{version}}

Hi,

Please get ready for the manual testing of Tails {{version}}.

I've just started preparing the images. I will let you know
on this thread once they're available for download.

Here's the pad for testing coordination:

    {{pad}}

Please "tag" tests that you are doing so we don't duplicate work.

Please test by {{end}}.

I expect feedback on the pad but if you have questions, I'll try to be on XMPP.

After the release, feel free to report to <tails-accounting@boum.org>
the time you spent on these tests: you can get paid for them.

Meanwhile, you can get an idea of what will be in Tails {{version}} in:

{% if dist == 'stable' %}
    https://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_stable/
{% elif dist == 'alpha' %}
**FIXME**:

  - for the first release candidate, use devel (you just created the testing
    branch and there's no build of testing yet):

    https://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_devel/

  - for subsequent release candidates, use testing:

    https://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_testing/
{% else %}
    **ERROR**: unsupported dist variable: {{dist}}
{% endif %}

Thanks a lot in advance,
cheers!
