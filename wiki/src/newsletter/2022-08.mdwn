Here are some news about what your donations to Tails make possible, our
plans for the coming months, and how to make the most of your Tails.

Let us know if this newsletter doesn't display correctly, so we can improve
next time.

Meet our new Project Manager
============================

Jessie, aka. `disoj`, joined Tails in April. It's the first time that we hired
for a managerial position. It's a very big and positive change that will help
our team grow, mature, and ultimately serve our users better.

> I come to Tails with a background working with engineering teams both as a
> project and engineering manager. I have worked at a variety of different
> organizations, from small startups to larger, more established companies. A
> highlight of my career so far was my time as the Engineering Manager at
> Mozilla for the Platform Graphics team working on Firefox.
> 
> I decided to be a part of Tails because I wanted to use my skills and
> experience to help advance causes that I care about, and think are important.
>
> My first few months here have been spent learning as much as I can about the
> history of Tails, how the team currently functions, and where I might be able
> to help out. I am particularly excited to help the team develop a cohesive
> 3-year strategy to help build more alignment and clarity around how we will
> continue to advance our mission.

We are now looking for a [Fundraising
Lead](https://tails.net/jobs/fundraising/). Please help us find the right
person!

We heard you
============

Recent releases include important fixes to some of the most common complaints
from users:

- In [Tails 5.0](https://tails.net/news/version_5.0/), we added
  [*Kleopatra*](https://tails.net/doc/encryption_and_privacy/kleopatra/) to replace our previous
  PGP tools, the *OpenPGP Applet* and the *Password and Keys* utility, also
  known as *Seahorse*.

  The *OpenPGP Applet* was not actively developed anymore and was complicated
  for us to keep in Tails. The *Password and Keys* utility was also poorly
  maintained and our users suffered from too many of its issues.

  We learned that 49% of our users used these tools from a [survey on our
  website](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/blueprints/-/wikis/user_survey/openpgp_and_pidgin)
  and couldn't let them down. [Daniel
  Moßbrucker](https://tails.net/contribute/how/user_experience/interviews/daniel) gave us the
  idea of including *Kleopatra*.

- Since [Tails 5.1](https://tails.net/news/version_5.1/), the *Tor Connection* assistant
  automatically fixes the computer clock if you choose to connect to Tor
  automatically.

  Time synchronizing has been a major usability problem for Tails users facing
  nationwide censorship and using Tor bridges in Russia, Iran, or China.

  You can learn more about our security assessment of this time synchronization
  in our [design documentation about non-Tor
  traffic](https://tails.net/contribute/design/Tor_enforcement/#non-tor-traffic).

  Since we first released the *Tor Connection* assistant in July 2021, we fixed
  21 of the 36 usability issues that we identified during the initial usability
  tests of this new feature.

New Persistent Storage upcoming
===============================

The Persistent Storage hasn't changed much since its first release in 2012
because the current code is hard to modify and improve. But, we learned from
our users that it could do a lot more for them if it had more features and be
much easier to use.

We've worked hard since 2021 on implementing a [new
design](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/blueprints/-/wikis/Persistent-Storage-redesign).
It won't require restarting each time you activate a new feature and will make
it easier to persist more settings in the future. We plan to release it before
the end of the year.

Until then, you can test our experimental [USB image](https://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_17803-rewrite-persistent-storage-settings-force-all-tests/lastSuccessful/archive/latest.img)!
Don't use it for security just yet.

Internet Freedom links
======================

- [How Tor Is Fighting—and Beating—Russian
  Censorship](https://www.wired.com/story/tor-browser-russia-blocks/) and
  [Roskomsvoboda lawyers succeeded in lifting the blocking of the Tor Project
  site](https://roskomsvoboda.org/post/rks-lawyers-tor-project-site-appellate-court/) are hopeful news about the state of anticensorship tools in Russia.

- In [Congestion Control Arrives in Tor
  0.4.7](https://blog.torproject.org/congestion-contrl-047/), Mike Perry from
  Tor explains the engineering feat that he has released to make the Tor
  network faster. Tor 0.4.7 was included in [Tails 5.1](https://tails.net/news/version_5.1/).

- [The Invisible Cyber-War with Nicole
  Perlroth](https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/55-the-invisible-cyber-war)
  dives into how our most critical infrastructure can be hacked: oil pipelines,
  water treatment facilities, and nuclear power plants.
