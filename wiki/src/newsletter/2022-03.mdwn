Our biggest fundraising campaign ever
=====================================

Thanks a lot to everybody who donated to Tails last year!

Our 2021 campaign raised more money than ever. We received **$154&#8239;885**
from 2038 donors. That's 27% more money than last year.

Your generous donation will keep safe the people who need it the most and
protect freedom in the digital age.

Using Tails to fight child abuse
================================

<img src="https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/user_experience/interviews/daniel.jpg" alt=""/>

In 2021, the journalist [Daniel Moßbrucker](https://daniel-mossbrucker.de/)
used Tails to investigate pedocriminal forums on the Darknet and took down
13.5 terabytes of photos and videos of child abuse.

He discovered that, despite the takedown of one of the biggest pedocriminal
forum *BoysTown* by German authorities in April 2021, many of the content was
still accessible online through regular file sharing websites on the clear web.

> 13.5 terabytes is like watching a video, in HD quality, for 365 days, every
> day, 24/7, of a child being abused. We, as journalists, collected and
> reported this amount of data in one day. Less than an hour later, the file
> sharing companies, who were stunned, deleted 28&#8239;000 links.

He then reached out to the German authorities asking them why they don't seem
to be doing the easy work of actually removing the content from the Internet
and limit themselves to prosecute the criminals.

New installation pages
======================

In December 2021, we traveled to Mexico to test the usability of our
installation process with local activists. This made us realize that our
installation pages were still hard to navigate for some: 2 out of 5
participants got lost in the process and only 1 verified their download.

We improved and simplified our installation pages a lot to fix these usability
issues based on what we learned by observing these activists.

Now, the entire installation process is described on a single page for each
operating system: [Windows](https://tails.boum.org/install/windows),
[macOS](https://tails.boum.org/install/mac),
[Linux](https://tails.boum.org/install/linux), or [Debian or Ubuntu using the
command line and GnuPG](https://tails.boum.org/install/expert).

Get more out of your Tails
==========================

Backup utility
--------------

Since Tails 4.25, you can make a backup of the Persistent Storage to another
Tails USB stick from **Applications**&nbsp;▸ **System Tools**&nbsp;▸ **Back Up
Persistent Storage**.

<img src="https://tails.boum.org/news/version_4.25/backup.png" alt=""/>

This utility automates the process described until now in our documentation on
[making a backup of your Persistent
Storage](https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/backup), which used the command line.

It's pretty basic and we still want to do something better in
[#7049](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/7049),
but we didn't want to wait more because we know that backups are a big
issue for our users.

Thanks a lot to David A. Wheeler for sending us the initial code!

External hard disk
------------------

You can now start Tails from an external hard disk instead of a USB stick.

Using an external hard disk can give you more space for your Persistent Storage
and be faster and more reliable than USB sticks.

To do so, choose the new entry called **Tails (External Hard Disk)** in the
GRUB boot loader.

Internet freedom links
======================

- [Russia's Internet censorship machine is going after
  Tor](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-block-tor-censorship/) since
  December. But Russian users are still craving uncensored and accurate

  Tor bridges](https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-bridge-table.html).

- [Darknet Diaries: NotPetya](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/54/) is a

  can better protect them.
