Highlights
==========

- [Radically Open Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/) audited the
  security of the new Persistent Storage, our migration to Wayland, and the
  Unsafe Browser.

  We already started releasing fixes to the issues that they identified. We
  will publish more about this audit and our mitigation plans in the coming
  months.

- We [analyzed the usability
  tests](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20230510.091842.23ed75ba.en.html)
  of the Persistent Storage done in March in Ecuador.

- We applied to the [Spyware Accountability
  Initiative](https://fordfoundation.forms.fm/spyware-accountability-initiative-spring-2023-request-for-concept-notes/forms/9600)
  to improve Tails for the journalists who use Tails to investigate and report
  on spyware or protect themselves from spyware in sensitive data.

- Our entire team gathered in Paris, France to discuss internal matters,
  financial and product strategy.

Releases
========

[[Tails 5.12 was released on April 19.|news/version_5.12]]

It fixes many usability and reliability issues in the new Persistent Storage:

- After you turn off a feature of the Persistent Storage, you can now click the
  **Delete Data** button to delete the data stored for this feature.

- When creating the Persistent Storage, a random and very secure passphrase is
  now displayed as a suggestion, using the diceware technique.

- Use a new icon for the backup utility for the Persistent Storage.

- Improve the error message when a feature of the Persistent Storage fails
  to activate from the Welcome Screen to clarify which feature is affected.

- Make the activation of the Persistent Storage more reliable in 2 error
  cases. ([[!tails_ticket 19376]] and [[!tails_ticket 19331]])

- Add a progress indicator while turning on a new feature to clarify that
  it can take some time. ([[!tails_ticket 19291]])

- Make sure that all data that is already available in Tails is really
  copied to the USB stick when turning on a feature. ([[!tails_ticket 19368]])
