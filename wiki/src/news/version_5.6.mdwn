<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Update *Tor Browser* to [11.5.5](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-1155).

- Update the *Linux* kernel to 5.10.149. This should improve the support for newer
  hardware: graphics, Wi-Fi, and so on.

<h1 id="fixes">Fixed problems</h1>

- When a manual upgrade is required, Tails now always points to the release
  notes of the latest version, instead of pointing sometimes to a deprecated
  version. ([[!tails_ticket 17069]])

For more details, read our [[!tails_gitweb debian/changelog desc="changelog"]].

## To upgrade your Tails USB stick and keep your persistent storage

- Automatic upgrades are available from Tails 5.0 or later to 5.6.

  You can [[reduce the size of the download|doc/upgrade#reduce]] of future
  automatic upgrades by doing a manual upgrade to the latest version.

- If you cannot do an automatic upgrade or if Tails fails to start after an
  automatic upgrade, please try to do a [[manual upgrade|doc/upgrade/#manual]].
