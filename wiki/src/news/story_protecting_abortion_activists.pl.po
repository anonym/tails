"In August, we traveled to Brazil to learn how to improve Tails for the many "

"We also met Gabriela, a feminist hacker who has been training low-income "

"Gabriela introduced these women to Tails by mixing up local culture and "
"privacy technology and presenting Tails as a *patuá*, a type of Brazilian "

"These women didn't have computers of their own and used the computers at "

"Some of them had their home raided by the police after being denounced for "
