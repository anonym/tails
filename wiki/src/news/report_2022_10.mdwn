Highlights
==========

Here's a glimpse at what happened in Tails in September and October.

Analyzing results of usability tests
------------------------------------

We analyzed the results of the usability tests we did in São Paulo:

 - [first-time use](https-everywhere://lists.autistici.org/message/20221012.181235.a673efeb.en.html)
 - [Tor Connection](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20221012.140611.7e58f067.en.html)

Then we prioritized the issues identified there and planned to fix
a bunch of them in the next few months.

New features
------------

Our developers brought 3 major new features to beta quality:

 - New Persistent Storage, completely redesigned and vastly more usable

 - Wayland and better Unsafe Browser, for better security in depth and
   usability

 - QR code scanning for Tor bridges

We will only release these features officially in Tails 5.8 (December 2022),
but you can [[try them already in Tails 5.8~beta1|news/test_5.8-beta1]]!

Donation campaign
-----------------

We launched our end-of-year donation campaign.

Donations from passionate people like you are our most valuable source of
funding because they guarantee our independence. We are a very small nonprofit
and our yearly budget is ridiculously small compared to the value of Tails.
  
[[Donate now|/donate]] to fight surveillance and censorship!

Releases
========

[[Tails 5.5 was released on October 17|news/version_5.5]], including:

- Update *Thunderbird* to [102.3.0](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/102.3.0/releasenotes/).

  *Thunderbird* 102 is a major update with [many changes to the navigation,
folder icons, and address
book](https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/06/thunderbird-102-released-a-serious-upgrade-to-your-communication/).

  *Thunderbird* 102 also includes important usability improvements to the
  OpenPGP feature. When composing an email, you can now see whether it will be
  encrypted or not. If encryption is impossible, a key assistant helps you
  solve key issues.

- Always ask to configure a screen locking password when pressing Ctrl+L and no
  administration pasword was set. ([[!tails_ticket 19090]])
