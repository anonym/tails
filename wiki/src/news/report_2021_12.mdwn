Hiring a Project Manager
========================

We published a [[job offer for a Project Manager|jobs/project_manager]] and
reviewed the first 50 applicants.

We were very impressed by the quality of the applicants and this gives us a lot
of hope for the future of the project.

We selected 6 applicants that we will interview in January.

We are still reviewing new applications! Please pass the word :)

Automatic time synchronization
==============================

We wrote a prototype to automate the synchronization of the computer's clock
before connecting to the Tor network. ([[!tails_ticket 18717]])

This will help people living in Eastern Europe and Asia connect to Tor bridges
from Tails.

When users decide to [[connect to the Tor network
automatically|doc/anonymous_internet/tor#automatic]], Tails will connect to
Fedora's captive portal detection *without going through Tor* to automatically
correct the clock before connecting to Tor.

You can read more about our security
design
and [current implementation
plans](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/blueprints/-/wikis/robust_time_syncing#current-plan)
or test the [nightly
build](https://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_18717-time-sync-before-tor/lastStable/archive/latest.img)
of our prototype.

Usability tests of first-time use
=================================

We did some usability tests of our installation instructions. We recruited 5
activists with interest in privacy technologies and observed them while they
downloaded, installed, and started Tails for the first time. We hadn't tested
this entire flow since 2015 and so many things happened since then.

* 3 of them had a pretty good installation experience of 10-20 minutes,
  download excluded. This process became much easier since 2015 thanks to the
  distribution of USB images instead of ISO images.

* 2 of them went a very bad route and took more than 1 hour to install Tails
  despite us rescuing them along the way. The good news is that we could help
  these people with only changes to the website.

You can see the detailed findings and the 19 GitLab issues that we created from
these usability tests in this [rainbow
table](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/ux/-/raw/master/first-time/rainbow_table.fods?inline=false)
or read a more [detailed
report](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20211217.014522.68cdc460.en.html). ([[!tails_ticket 18074]])

We also published our [[policy for the retention of the user research
data|contribute/how/user_experience/research]] gathered during such activities.

Metrics
=======

- The Russian translation of our [[documentation about connecting to the Tor
  network|doc/anonymous_internet/tor]] was the top growing page on our website,
  according to Google Search.

  This happened while [Russia started blocking
  Tor](https://ooni.org/post/2021-russia-blocks-tor/) in December.

  We are very proud to have released the Russian translation of our entire user
  documentation in October and released the [[*Tor Connection* assistant in
  July|news/version_4.20]] to make it easier for people to circumvent this kind
  of censorship.

  We estimate that 4 times more people are using bridges from Tails since the
  release of *Tor Connection*, from the *WhisperBack* reports that we receive
  from users.

- Tails has been started more than 752&#8239;953 times this month. This makes
  24&#8239;289 boots a day on average.
