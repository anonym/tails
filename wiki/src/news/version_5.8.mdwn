Tails 5.8 is the most important release of Tails in years. It includes both
major redesign of existing features, important usability improvements, and
hardened security.

## New Persistent Storage

After 2 years of hard work, we are extremelly proud to present you a complete
redesign of the Persistent Storage.

The Persistent Storage hasn't changed much since its first release in 2012
because the code was hard to modify and improve. But, we learned from users
that the Persistent Storage could do a lot more for you if it had more features
and was easier to use.

[[!img configure.png link="no" alt=""]]

- You don't have to restart anymore after creating the Persistent Storage or
  each time you activate a new feature.

- You can change the password of your Persistent Storage from this new
  application.

- You can choose to create a Persistent Storage directly from the Welcome
  Screen, if you don't have one already.

## Wayland and better Unsafe Browser

We replaced the deprecated X.Org display system with Wayland.

Even if you won't notice any visual difference, Wayland brings more security in
depth to Tails by making it harder for a compromised application in Tails to
compromise or misuse another application.

For example, since [[Tails 4.8|news/version_4.8]], the *Unsafe Browser* was
disabled by default because a security vulnerability in another application in
Tails could start an invisible *Unsafe Browser*, reveal your IP address, and
[[deanonymize you|doc/anonymous_internet/unsafe_browser#security]].

Wayland fixes this vulnerability and makes it safe to reenable the *Unsafe Browser*
by default. You can still disable the *Unsafe Browser* in the Welcome Screen.

Wayland also brings in other features that were not working yet in the *Unsafe
Browser*:

- Sound
- Uploads and downloads
- Alternative input methods for Chinese and other non-Latin languages
- Accessibility features like the screen reader and virtual keyboard

## QR code scanning of Tor bridges

We made it easier to enter new Tor bridges in Tails by scanning a QR code.

To get a QR code, you can either:

- Send an empty email to <bridges@torproject.org> from a Gmail or Riseup email
  address.

- Get bridges from <https://bridges.torproject.org/> and print the QR code on
  paper.

We are aware that the QR codes that are currently provided are too big to be
easy to scan. We are [working with
Tor](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/bridgedb/-/issues/40052)
to make them smaller and easier to scan.

<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Update *Tor Browser* to [12.0.1](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-1201).

- Update *Thunderbird* to [102.6.0](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/102.6.0/releasenotes/).

- Update *Tor* to 0.4.7.12.

<h1 id="fixes">Fixed problems</h1>

We fixed 3 usability issues in the *Tor Connection* assistant:

- Display a percentage on the connection progress bar. ([[!tails_ticket 19208]])

  [[!img progress.png link="no" alt=""]]

- Fix links to documentation. ([[!tails_ticket 19172]])

- Add a **Bridge** label in front of the line to enter a custom bridge. ([[!tails_ticket 19169]])

For more details, read our [[!tails_gitweb debian/changelog desc="changelog"]].

<h1 id="issues">Known issues</h1>

- The switches that turn on and off the different features of the Persistent Storage
  are very slow to respond on some USB sticks. Please report on [[!tails_ticket
  19291]] if this happens to you.

- The top of the Welcome Screen is cut out on small displays (800×600), like
  virtual machines. ([[!tails_ticket 19324]])

  You can press **Alt+S** to start Tails.

- When using a custom Tor `obfs4` bridge, the progress bar of *Tor Connection*
  sometimes gets stuck halfway through and becomes extremelly slow. ([[!tails_ticket 19173]])

  To fix this, you can either:

  * Close and reopen *Tor Connection* to speed up the initial connection.

  * Try a different `obfs4` bridge.

    This issue only affects outdated obfs4 bridges and does not happen with
    obfs4 bridges that run version 0.0.12 or later.

See the list of [[long-standing issues|support/known_issues]].

## To upgrade your Tails USB stick and keep your persistent storage

  You can [[reduce the size of the download|doc/upgrade#reduce]] of future
