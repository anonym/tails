Highlights
==========

- We are hiring a [[Fundraising Lead|jobs/fundraising]]. Please help us pass
  the word!

- We made lots of progress on a complete rewrite of the Persistent Storage that
  implements a [new
  design](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/blueprints/-/wikis/Persistent-Storage-redesign)
  from 2021.

  For example, the new Persistent Storage won't require restarting each time
  you activate a new feature and will make it easier to persist more settings
  in the future.

  You can sneak peek at our experimental [USB
  image](https://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_17803-rewrite-persistent-storage-settings-force-all-tests/lastSuccessful/archive/latest.img)!
  Don't use it for security just yet.

- We did an initial deployment of
  [Mirrorbits](https://github.com/etix/mirrorbits) to handle our downloads,
  instead of our current custom scripts. Mirrorbits will make downloads more
  reliable by freeing us from some manual maintenance work when a mirror goes
  down, make downloads a bit faster by optimizing based on IP locations, and
  allow us to do stats on the number of downloads.

  We also bought the domain name [tails.net](https://tails.net/), so this new
  infra will live under <https://download.tails.net/> in some weeks.

- We travelled to Brazil to meet local activists, train them on Tails, and do
  usability test of [[!tails_ticket 18762 desc="Tor Connection"]] and
  [[!tails_ticket 18784 desc="18784"]].

  The many fixes that we did to the installation instructions since we last
  tested them in [[!tails_ticket 18074 desc="December 2021"]] gave excellent
  results. All the test participants could install and start Tails pretty
  easily!
