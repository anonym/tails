Highlights
==========

- 2 more sponsors renewed their support for Tails! [Look to the
  Right](https://www.looktotheright.com/) and [Nym
  Technologies](https://nymtech.net/). We are all so grateful for their
  generosity.

- Tails now uses LUKS2 with Argon2id by default for all new Persistent Storage
  and LUKS encrypted volumes. Until Tails 5.12, Tails created LUKS devices
  version 1 (LUKS1) with PBKDF2 to derive cryptographic keys. But, PBKDF2 no
  longer offers adequate protection against brute force attacks. We published an
  extensive [security advisory](https://tails.net/security/argon2id/) for this
  migration.

- We also published the [entire Puppet
  codebase](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/puppet-code) that manages the
  Tails infrastructure. Have a look under the hood!

Releases
========

[Tails 5.14 was released on 16 June 2023](https://tails.boum.org/news/version_5.14/index.en.html).

- Tails 5.14 automatically converts your Persistent Storage to use LUKS2
  encryption with Argon2id. 

- Persistent Storage is not only more secure, but also more usable now. We've
  brought back descriptions of some of the Persistent Storage features, and the
  button on the welcome page that creates Persistent Storage is now a switch
  instead of a button.

- Many people use Tails to secure their Bitcoin wallet. All Electrum users on
  Tails can now donate to Tails through Electrum itself. Tails runs on your
  donations!

Metrics
=======

Tails was started more than 750,346 times this month. That's a daily average of over 25,012 boots.
