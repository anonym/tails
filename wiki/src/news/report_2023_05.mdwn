Highlights
==========

- We started serving the Tails website under the `tails.net` domain. Until now, we have been redirecting to`tails.boum.org`. The full migration will still take some time.

- We have 2 new sponsors for this year! [ThinkPenguin](https://www.thinkpenguin.com/about) renewed their support, and another individual came on-board, but prefers to remain anoynomous. 

- Between 2021 and 2023 we partnered with [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), and the [Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/) to organise training and usability tests in Ecuador, Mexico, and Brazil. Drawing this work to a close, we organised an online workshop for digital security trainers at the request of [Sursiendo](https://sursiendo.org/quienes-somos/). We shared experiences about the training, and discussed past and future updates to Tails.

Releases
========

[[Tails 5.13 was released on May 16|news/version_5.13]]

- Tails now uses LUKS2 by default for all new Persistent Storage and LUKS encrypted volumes. LUKS2 provide stronger cryptography by default. A migration plan from LUKS1 to LUKS2 for the existing Persistent Storage is in [Tails 5.14](https://tails.net/news/version_5.14/index.en.html).

- You can now download files from the command-line interface using curl. curl's versatility can be useful for online investigations as an alternative to wget.

Metrics
=======

Tails has been started more than 765,853 times this month. That's over 24,705 boots a day on average.
