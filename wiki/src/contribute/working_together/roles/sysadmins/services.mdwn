[[!meta title="Services managed by Tails Sysadmins"]]
[[!meta robots="noindex"]]

[[!toc levels=1]]

Below, importance level is evaluated based on:

* users' needs: e.g. if the APT repository is down, then the
  _Additional Software_ feature is broken;
* developers' needs: e.g. if the ISO build fails, then developers
  cannot work;
* the release process' needs: we want to be able to do an emergency
  release at any time when critical security issues are published.
  Note that in order to release Tails, one needs to first build Tails,
  so any service that's needed to build Tails is also needed to release Tails.
