# Adding new Persistent Storage features

Take these steps to add a new preset feature to the Persistent Storage:

1. Add a new `Feature` subclass to
   [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/tps/configuration/features.py]].

2. Add a new `Feature` subclass to
   [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/tps_frontend/views/features_view.py]].

3. Add a new `HdyActionRow` child to the `GtkListBox` of the
   corresponding section you want to add the feature to.


You might need to add on-activated/on-deactivated hooks:
* [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/lib/persistent-storage/on-activated-hooks]]
* [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/lib/persistent-storage/on-deactivated-hooks]]

If you do, it's **important** that all privileged accesses of paths which
are writable by an unprivileged user (e.g. `amnesia`) are done via the
`/run/nosymfollow` mountpoint to avoid symlink attacks. For more
information, see the section on symlink attacks in
[[contribute/design/persistence]].

Note that's is possible that on-activated hooks are run multiple times
without the on-deactivated hooks being run in between, so they must
handle that case gracefully.
