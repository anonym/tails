<h1 id="scheduling">Scheduling</h1>

It's good to have 3-hours slots with actual tests from 00:30 to 02:30.

It's interesting to have 2 tests each day and spread them out as much as
possible to adjust to no-shows and fix the most obvious issues between them.

Fridays and Saturdays are better than Sundays and week days.

During the tests
================

Use the [usability testing checklist](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/ux/-/raw/master/tools/usability_testing_checklist.fodt).
