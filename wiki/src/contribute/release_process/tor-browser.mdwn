[[!meta title="Upgrading the Tor Browser"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

The big picture
===============

The Tails build system [[!tails_gitweb
config/chroot_local-hooks/10-tbb desc="downloads"]] a set of Tor
Browser tarballs from a location specified in [[!tails_gitweb
config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-dist-url.txt]], and
compares their hash with previously verified ones found in
[[!tails_gitweb
config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-sha256sums.txt]].

Once released officially, Tor Browser tarballs can be found in
a [permanent (?)
location](https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/).
However, when upgrading Tor Browser for an imminent Tails release, we
generally have to use Tor Browser tarballs that are under QA and not
officially released yet. So, we have to retrieve them from another,
temporary location, such as
<http://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/builds/>. If we hard-coded
this temporary URL in `tbb-dist-url.txt`, then our release tag would
only be buildable for as long the tarballs stay in that place, which
at best is a few months.

To solve this, we host ourselves the Tor Browser tarballs we need, and
point to [this permanent
location](https://torbrowser-archive.tails.boum.org/) for anything that
we tag.

Still, one can set an arbitrary download location in
`tbb-dist-url.txt`, which should provide all the flexibility needed
for development purposes.

Occasionally, the new Tor Browser requires adjustments to the corresponding
AppArmor profile: [[tor-browser/AppArmor_policy]].

Upgrade Tor Browser in Tails
============================

Wait
------------

Have a look at

* <https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/?C=M;O=D>
* <https://tb-build-05.torproject.org/~richard/builds/release/unsigned/?C=M;O=D>
* <https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/?C=M;O=D>
* <https://people.torproject.org/~gk/builds/?C=M;O=D>
* <https://people.torproject.org/~boklm/builds/?C=M;O=D>
* <https://people.torproject.org/~pierov/builds/?C=M;O=D>
* <https://people.torproject.org/~richard/builds/tor-browser/?C=M;O=D>

and see if the desired version is available. If it's not, and you want to
"poll", you can use this:

  - copy the URLs above in `/tmp/tbb-urls.txt`
  - `export TBB_VERSION=1.2.3.4`
  - run this snippet (bash only!)

    ```sh
    (
        set -eu
        typeset -a tbbUrls
        mapfile -t tbbUrls < <(grep -F --no-filename https: /tmp/tbb-urls.txt |sed -e 's+^ *++;s+ *$++')
        while true
        do
            if (for u in "${tbbUrls[@]}"; do
                elinks -no-numbering -no-references -dump "$u" | sed -e "s+^+[${u//+/ }]+" ; done
                )| grep -F -e "${TBB_VERSION?}" -e "$(date +%F)"  -e "$(date +%F -d yesterday)" --color=always
            then
                echo FOUND
                notify-send "Release dir" 'found'
            fi
            sleep 10m
        done
    )
    ```

Verify
------------

Set `TBB_DIST_URL` to the chosen URL, and set `TBB_VERSION` to the desired Tor
Browser version, for example:

    TBB_DIST_URL=https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/builds/4.5-build5/
    TBB_VERSION="$(basename "${TBB_DIST_URL:?}")"

<div class="caution">
Ensure you include the "-buildN" part. Add it if it's missing.
</div>

Set `TBB_TAILS_TICKET` to the number of the ticket about updating Tor
Browser, and `TBB_IMPORT_BRANCH` to the branch we'll work on, which
must include the `+force-all-tests` suffix:

    TBB_TAILS_TICKET=123456
    TBB_IMPORT_BRANCH=${TBB_TAILS_TICKET:?}-tor-browser-${TBB_VERSION%%-*}+force-all-tests

Check out the new branch:

    git checkout -b ${TBB_IMPORT_BRANCH:?} origin/stable

Set `TBB_SIGNER_SUFFIX` to the nickname of the Tor Browser developer who signed
the `sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt` file, preceeded by a dash; the detached
signature at `$TBB_DIST_URL` is named
`sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt.asc${TBB_SIGNER_SUFFIX}`:

    TBB_SIGNER_SUFFIX='-boklm'

Note: sometimes, the detached signature is called `sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt.asc`, with no suffix.
If that's the case, just set it to an empty string

Fetch the version's hash file and its detached signature, and verify
with GnuPG:

    (
        set -e
        for f in sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt{.asc${TBB_SIGNER_SUFFIX?},}; do
            wget "${TBB_DIST_URL:?}/$f" -O "$f"
        done
        gpg --verify sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt{.asc${TBB_SIGNER_SUFFIX?},}
    )


Build the list of tarballs we want and their hashes,
so this information is available at build time,
when the tarballs are fetched:

    (
        grep --color=never -E \
            "\stor-browser-linux64-[0-9].*_en-US\.tar\.xz$" \
            sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt \
        && grep --color=never -E \
            "\slangpacks-tor-browser-linux64-.*\.tar\.xz$" \
            sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt \
    ) > config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-sha256sums.txt

Set download url
---------------------

### If `TBB_DIST_URL` supports http

Then update the URL to the one chosen above:

    echo "${TBB_DIST_URL:?}" | sed "s,^https://,http://," > \
         config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-dist-url.txt

<div class="note">
<p>
We cannot use HTTPS: building Tails uses a caching HTTP proxy
by default and there's no way such a proxy caches data without
MitM'ing connections. However, it is of no consequence since
we verify the checksum file.
</p>
</div>

### Else

Nowadays (since 2022) it is common that tarballs are put on a webserver that doesn't support http: it will
redirect to https.
 `https://tb-build-05.torproject.org/` is one of those.

If this is the case, you must put those tarballs on a server that allows us to use plain HTTP.

We cannot use such a server directly, so we need to (at least temporarily) self-host this.

#### If you can access torbrowser-archive.git

    echo "${TBB_DIST_URL:?}" > \
         config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-dist-url.txt
    git commit config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-*.txt \
        -m "Upgrade Tor Browser to ${TBB_VERSION:?}" && \
    git show

Please refer to [Self-hosted Tor Browser tarballs archive|#self-host]] section.

#### If you can't access it

Download the relevant files:

```sh
 (
    grep --color=never -Eo \
        '\stor-browser-linux64-[0-9].*_en-US\.tar\.xz$' \
        sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt \
    && grep --color=never -Eo \
        '\slangpacks-tor-browser-linux64-.*\.tar\.xz$' \
        sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt \
) | sed -re "s@^\s*@${TBB_DIST_URL:?}@" | xargs wget -c
```

Now, put them on some webserver that you can control. Let's say you uploaded them to
`http://myserver.net/misc/tbb/`. Put *that* URL in `config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-dist-url.txt`



Commit
-----------

Lastly, commit:

    git commit config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-*.txt \
        -m "Upgrade Tor Browser to ${TBB_VERSION:?}" && \
    git show

<div class="caution">
<p>
If this new Tor Browser is meant to be included in a Tails
release, then that's not enough: as explained above, we need to host
the corresponding tarballs ourselves, so read on the next section.
</p>
</div>

Sync with the upstream wrapper scripts
======================================

Adapt our `config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/bin/tor-browser`
and/or
`config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/lib/tails-shell-library/tor-browser.sh`
for recent changes made in the Tor Browser build Git repo
(`git clone https://git.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-build.git`),
on the `maint-X.Y-desktop` branch (if it does not exist, fall back to `maint-X.Y`):

    git log -p \
        projects/firefox/abicheck.cc \
        projects/firefox/start-firefox \
        projects/tor-browser/RelativeLink/start-tor-browser

Then apply any relevant change, e.g. to:

 - environment variables;
 - commandline options passed to the `firefox` executable;
 - required libstdc++6 version bumps; if there's been any change upstream,
   look for `abicheck` in `config/chroot_local-hooks/10-tbb` and adjust
   that hook as needed.

Self-hosted Tor Browser tarballs archive
========================================

Initial setup
-------------

First, install [[!debpts git-annex]].

Then, make sure you have an entry for `git.puppet.tails.boum.org` in
your `~/.ssh/config`. For details, see `ISO_history.mdwn`
in [[!tails_gitlab tails/rm]].

Then, clone the metadata repository and initialize git-annex:

	git clone gitolite@git.puppet.tails.boum.org:torbrowser-archive.git && \
	cd torbrowser-archive && \
	git annex init

You now have a lot of (dangling) symlinks in place of the files that are
available in this git-annex repo.

To synchronize your local git-annex metadata with the remote, run:

	git annex sync

Set up environment variables
----------------------------

1. Make sure you still have the environment variables defined in the
   previous section set.

2. Make `TAILS_GIT_REPO` point to the main Tails Git repository
   checkout where `tbb-dist-url.txt` is being worked on, for example:

        TAILS_GIT_REPO="$HOME/tails/git"

3. Make `TBB_ARCHIVE` point to your local git annex working
   copy of our Tor Browser archive, for example:

        TBB_ARCHIVE="$HOME/tails/torbrowser-archive"

Import a new set of Tor Browser tarballs
----------------------------------------

1. Download and verify all the tarballs we need:

        DL_DIR=$(mktemp --tmpdir -d "tor-browser-${TBB_VERSION}.XXXXXXXXXX")
        CHROOT_INCLUDES="config/chroot_local-includes"
        TBB_SHA256SUMS_FILE="${CHROOT_INCLUDES:?}/usr/share/tails/tbb-sha256sums.txt"
        TBB_DIST_URL_FILE="${CHROOT_INCLUDES:?}/usr/share/tails/tbb-dist-url.txt"
        cd "${TAILS_GIT_REPO:?}" && git checkout "${TBB_IMPORT_BRANCH:?}"
        TBB_TARBALLS_BASE_URL="$(cat "${TBB_DIST_URL_FILE:?}" | sed "s,^http://,https://,")"
        current_branch=$(git -C "${TAILS_GIT_REPO:?}" branch | awk '/^\* / { print $2 }')
        for branch in "$current_branch" ; do
           git -C "${TAILS_GIT_REPO:?}" show "$branch:${TBB_SHA256SUMS_FILE:?}" \
           | while read expected_sha256 tarball; do
              (
                 cd "$DL_DIR"
                 echo "Retrieving '${TBB_TARBALLS_BASE_URL:?}/${tarball:?}'..."
                 curl --remote-name --retry 20 --continue-at - \
                    "${TBB_TARBALLS_BASE_URL:?}/${tarball:?}"
              )
           done
           (
              cd "${DL_DIR:?}" && \
              git -C "${TAILS_GIT_REPO:?}" show "$branch:${TBB_SHA256SUMS_FILE:?}" \
                 | sha256sum -c -
           )
        done

2. Import the tarballs into your local Git annex:

        cd "${TBB_ARCHIVE:?}" && \
        mkdir "${TBB_VERSION:?}" && cd "${TBB_VERSION:?}" && \
        git annex import --duplicate "${DL_DIR:?}/"* "${TAILS_GIT_REPO:?}/"sha256sums-*

Commit and push your changes
----------------------------

	cd "${TBB_ARCHIVE:?}" && \
	git commit -m "Add Tor Browser ${TBB_VERSION:?}" && \
	git annex sync && \
	git annex copy --to origin -- "${TBB_VERSION:?}" && \
	git annex sync

Adjust the URL in the main Git repository
-----------------------------------------

    cd "${TAILS_GIT_REPO:?}" && \
    git checkout "${TBB_IMPORT_BRANCH:?}"
    current_branch=$(git branch | awk '/^\* / { print $2 }')
    for branch in "${current_branch:?}" ; do
       git checkout "${branch:?}" && \
       echo "http://torbrowser-archive.tails.boum.org/${TBB_VERSION:?}/" > \
            config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-dist-url.txt && \
       git commit config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-dist-url.txt \
           -m "Fetch Tor Browser from our own archive" && \
       git show
    done

Wait for the synchronization
----------------------------

Before you can build Tails using Tor Browser from our own archive,
you need to wait for the tarballs to appear on
<https://torbrowser-archive.tails.boum.org/?C=M&O=D>. This can take up to
10 minutes.

Push the updated branch
-----------------------

	git push -o merge_request.create --set-upstream \
	   origin "${TBB_IMPORT_BRANCH:?}"

Clean up
--------

	cd "${TBB_ARCHIVE:?}" && \
	git annex drop -- "${TBB_VERSION:?}" && \
    git annex sync && \
    rm -rf "${DL_DIR:?}" && \
    cd "${TAILS_GIT_REPO:?}" && \
    rm -f sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt{,.asc${TBB_SIGNER_SUFFIX}}
