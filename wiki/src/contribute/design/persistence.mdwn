# What are we trying to achieve

## Introduction

As a live system designed to not leave any trace of its use on a
computer, Tails doesn't store any user data and configuration by
default. To still be able to use Tails without re-configuring all
used apps after each boot, Tails supports storing some
explicitly selected configuration and data persistently on an encrypted
volume.

## Requirements
Allow users to easily set up an encrypted volume and configure which
data and configuration should be stored persistently on the encrypted
volume.

## Design

### Technical overview

* Encrypted (LUKS) volume on the Tails device
* Configuration file containing source paths and destination paths
* Files are either bind-mounted or linked via symlinks
* Hooks are executed on activation / deactivation
* Setup and configuration is done via the Persistent Storage settings
  app
* User can choose which data and configuration (features) to
  store persistently from a pre-configured list
* In addition, users can make arbitrary files persistent by editing
  the config file manually
* Files and directories which are made persistent are copied to the
  Persistent Storage

### Components

* A privileged backend (tps backend): A D-Bus activated systemd service
  which exposes an API via the D-Bus system bus.
* A GTK app (Persistent Storage settings) which uses the API to allow
  the user to easily set up and configure the Persistent Storage.
* A command-line tool (`tpscli`) and shell library (`libtps.sh`) to
  allow other components of Tails to easily use the API to configure the
  Persistent Storage
* The [[Welcome Screen|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen]] allows to unlock
  and activate the Persistent Storage during boot.

### Backend

The backend is implemented as a D-Bus activated systemd service using
the D-Bus system bus. It exposes two interfaces:
* [[!tails_gitweb desc="org.boum.tails.PersistentStorage" config/chroot_local-includes/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/tps/service.py]]
* [[!tails_gitweb desc="org.boum.tails.PersistentStorage.Feature" config/chroot_local-includes/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/tps/configuration/feature.py]]

These interfaces are used by the frontend to make the properties and
methods available to the user.

The pre-configured features known to the backend are defined in
[[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/tps/configuration/features.py]].

## Activating and deactivating Persistent Storage Features

Each feature defines one or more files or directories which are stored
on the Persistent Storage when the feature is enabled and which
are made available in the filesystem via bindings. Two types of bindings
are supported: Bind mounts and symlink bindings. Bind mounts are simply
bind-mounted and the files of symlink bindings are made available via
symlinks. For examples and further explanation, see the
[[Configuration File|persistence#configuration-file]] section below.

### Initial activation

We want to support this user story:
 1. User opens an application and configures it
 2. Then, the user decides they want this configuration to persist

To support that, we copy the existing data for the bind mounts of a
feature to the Persistent Storage when the feature is activated and
there are no corresponding directories on the Persistent Storage yet.

### Conflicting apps

We have a pre-defined list of conflicting applications and processes that would
interfere with activating/deactivating a feature. For example, if the user is
activating the Thunderbird feature, and they are running Thunderbird already, we
can't just `mount` the directory at the proper place: Thunderbird would never
notice, and this would lead to all sort of incoherent states. To avoid
that, we check if any `thunderbird` processes are running and, if so,
tell the user to close Thunderbird to continue.

### Hooks

Hooks are executed on activation / deactivation:
* [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/lib/persistent-storage/on-activated-hooks]]
* [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/lib/persistent-storage/on-deactivated-hooks]]

They allow us to integrate the persistent data better into the system,
for example by adding a GNOME bookmark for the Persistent directory when
it is activated and removing it when it is deactivated.

### Configuration file

The configuration file is stored in
`/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/persistence.conf`.

When a feature is made persistent, a line is added to the config file
for each bind mount or symlink binding that belongs to the feature.

Example bind mount line:
```
# destination               options
/home/amnesia/Persistent    source=Persistent
```

This will cause the file or directory
`/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/Persistent` to be bind-mounted to
`/home/amnesia/Persistent`.

Example symlink line:
```
# destination   options
/home/amnesia	source=dotfiles,link
```

This will cause symlinks to be created below `/home/amnesia` for all
files in the `/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles` directory.
If there are files in subdirectories of the `dotfiles` directory, those
subdirectories are also created below `/home/amnesia`.

This can be used to make files such as `.gitconfig` or `.vimrc`
persistent.

## User interface

We provide a unified interface for creating, configuring and deleting a
Persistent Storage. Unlocking is done in the Welcome Screen during boot.

### Create Persistent Storage

#### Design

Running the Persistent Storage UI:

Brings the user to the configuration screen if they have an unlocked
Persistent Storage.

Else, we:
 * ask the user for a passphrase for the encryption (welcome bonus: pointing to
   the relevant documentation about choosing a *strong* passphrase)
 * create a LUKS-encrypted partition on the Tails USB stick
   - uses all the free space
   - labeled `TailsData`
   - create an ext4 filesystem in the encrypted container
   - set appropriate ownership (`CleartextDevice.mount()` in [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/tps/device.py]])
 * switch to the settings view

### Configure Persistent Storage features (i.e. which bits are persistent)

This is automatically run right after the Persistent Storage bootstrap
step. The user is enabled to change the configuration later.
Changes to the Persistent Storage settings are taken into account immediately.

#### Design

When the user sees this UI, it means either:
 - they have unlocked the Persistent Storage at the Welcome Screen
 - or, they just created it

By default, the "Create" UI will activate those features:
 - Persistent Folder
 - Additional Software

### Unlock the Persistent Storage at boot time

The Welcome Screen allows the user to unlock their Persistent Storage.

The decision of doing this so late in the boot process is a conscious
one: the Welcome Screen is a GTK application that can easily support
accessibility, an easy to use interface, keyboard layouts and input
systems.

We also don't support activating Persistent Storage after logging into
the GNOME Session.  It's full of corner cases, and we consider that
doing this in a way that gives a consistent interface to the user is
very expensive and not worth it.

Unlocking the Persistent Storage is optional: a user can start Tails
without unlocking it. If they do so, they won't be able to unlock it
later without rebooting.

#### Design

 1. The Welcome Screen asks the tps backend if there's a
    Persistent Storage available.
 2. The user enters the passphrase and clicks _Unlock_ in the
    Welcome Screen.
 3. The Welcome Screen calls the tps backend to unlock and activate
    the Persistent Storage.
 4. The tps backend decrypts the partition, mounts it, reads the
    config file and activates the bindings configured in the config file.
 5. The Welcome Screen displays a success or error message.

Additional software packages
----------------------------

The `tails-additional-software` script installs a list of
additional software packages stored in the Persistent Storage.
For details see [[additional_software_packages]].

Security
--------

### Storage access

The root directory of the Persistent Storage
(`/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked`) is created by the tps backend.
It's owned by `root:root` with permissions `0770`.
It is group-writable so that we can grant write access to other users 
with ACLs.

Additionally, ACLs grant search (`x`) access to the `amnesia` user, so
that it can follow the symlinks generated by the dotfiles feature.

### Privilege separation

Because the tps backend runs as root and performs privileged operations,
we only allow the Persistent Storage settings (tps frontend) and the
Welcome Screen to access call the privileged methods. The unprivileged
`amnesia` user is only allowed to read properties (so that we can
figure out in other unprivileged components in Tails if a feature is
active or not).
See [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/dbus-1/system.d/org.boum.tails.PersistentStorage.conf]].

The Welcome Screen is only started during boot and runs as its own user
(`Debian-gdm`), which we allow access to the backend.

The Persistent Storage settings app is started by the user in the
running Tails session and runs as the unprivileged `amnesia` user. To
still allow it access to the privileged methods, we do this:
* A wrapper script runs as the user `tails-persistent-storage` which is
  allowed to access the `org.boum.tails.PersistentStorage` bus via D-Bus:
  * [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/bin/tails-persistent-storage]]
  * [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/dbus-1/system.d/org.boum.tails.PersistentStorage.conf]]
* The wrapper script opens a file descriptor for the D-Bus system bus
  and drops privileges by executing the tps frontend as `amnesia` but
  passes the open file descriptor on to the tps frontend:
  * [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/lib/connect-drop-tps]]
* The tps frontend uses the open file descriptor to access the
  `org.boum.tails.PersistentStorage` bus.

### Symlink attacks

The target paths of the bindings can be below directories writable by
unprivileged users, for example `/home/amnesia/Persistent`. Because we
use those paths as the targets of privileged operations, we have to be
careful to avoid symlink attacks.

A symlink attack which allows amnesia to escalate privileges to root
could look like this:

1. Activate the Persistent Folder feature
2. Create a file `/home/amnesia/Persistent/sudoers`
3. Deactivate the Persistent Folder feature
4. Create a symlink `ln -s /etc /home/amnesia/Persistent`
5. Activate the Persistent Folder feature
6. The `sudoers` file created above is now in `/etc/sudoers`

A similar attack is possible with symlink bindings instead of
bind mounts:

1. Activate the Dotfiles feature
2. Create a directory `/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles/etc`
   and a file `sudoers` in it
3. Deactivate the Dotfiles feature
4. Create a symlink `ln -s /etc /home/amnesia/Persistent`
5. Activate the Dotfiles feature
6. The `sudoers` file created above is now in `/etc/sudoers`

To avoid this, we access all binding target paths via `/run/nosymfollow`,
which is a bind mount of `/` with the `nosymfollow` mount option. That
causes syscalls which access file paths with symlinks in it to fail with
"ELOOP - too many levels of symbolic links". An important exception is
the `readlink` (and `readlinkat`) system call which still resolves
symbolic links - so it's important that operations on the target path
do not call `readlink` (or `readlinkat`).

The on-activated/on-deactivated hooks are also executed as root and
some of them operate on directories controlled by unprivileged users,
so there we also have to use the `/run/nosymfollow` mountpoint to avoid
symlink attacks.
