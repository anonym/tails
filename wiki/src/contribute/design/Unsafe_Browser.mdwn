Rationale
=========

Internet connections restricted by captive portals pose a problem in
environments like Tails, where all Internet traffic is routed through
Tor. There's a catch 22 since the portal cannot be reached before Tor
is working (and it most likely isn't reachable through Tor any way)
and Tor cannot work before logging in to the portal. Since most (if
not all) of these portals are web based, a web browser with direct
Internet access seem required for avoiding this problem.

Requirements
============

* It must run a completely separate browser profile from the
  Torified browser.
* It must be hard to start by mistake.
* It must be hard to mistake for the Torified browser.
* It must be configured to use the DNS provided by DHCP (which is required
  by some captive portals).
* It must be able to reach captive portals
* We want to apply the Principle of Least Privilege: we consider this
  application very sensitive because it can easily deanonymize users
* It must be difficult for an attacker to leverage the Unsafe Browser as a way
  to gain unrestricted access to the network (and, thus, deanonymize users).

Implementation
==============

The aptly named *Unsafe Browser* implements all the above, although at
this time only a reasonable effort has been made to sandbox it to
fulfill the last point (restrict access to information).

User interface
--------------

The Unsafe Browser can be found in the `Applications -> Internet`
section (with a "warning triangle" as icon) and does the following
when started:

0. Show a dialog asking the user for verification, while also briefly
   explaining that the Unsafe Browser won't be anonymous.
0. "No" is the default answer, but if "Yes", we start a separate
   browser instance.
0. The browser is configured to use a theme with scary colors (red).
0. Its start page (locally stored) makes it clear that this is the Unsafe
   Browser and explains the issues involved with the Unsafe Browser
   and how to proceed from now on.

Security
--------

The Unsafe Browser is run in a restricted environment:

 - it runs in its own mount namespace, where (through the use of tmpfs and overlayfs):
   - no modifications can be made to the system
   - the system as shown as it was before booting. No modification to the state that happened after boot is
     visible
   - however, /home is fully readable and writable, and is just a bind-mount to the "normal" /home

 - it runs in its own network namespace
   - it can establish arbitrary TCP/UDP connections
   - it cannot contact local services, like Tor

 - Apparmor rules prevent it from accessing sensitive files:
   - Every file in Desktop, Downloads, Documents, etc.
   - Every file in home except `/home/amnesia/.*`
   - However, it can access `/home/amnesia/Tor Browser/` and `/home/amnesia/Persistent/Tor Browser/`.

This means that the Unsafe Browser cannot access most user files (with the exception of files in `Tor
Browser/`, reducing the risk of deanonymization.
It can also only go through the clearnet, but not interact with any other Tails service which could ever lead
to deanonymizaation.

### Attack scenarios and known issues

#### XWayland

UnsafeBrowser used (pre-5.8) to be run as an X.Org application. This was
knowingly insecure. The switch to Wayland gave us better security properties.

However, can an amnesia-level attacker force UnsafeBrowser to run as an XWayland
application?

It cannot. In fact, the Unsafe Browser is not allowed to access XWayland, because it runs in a different
network namespace (see [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/lib/unsafe-browser]]), and we
don't setup any way (like bind mounts) to make it possible to access it.

#### Opening the Unsafe Browser

Opening the Unsafe Browser requires arbitrary code execution as `amnesia`: all
of the most-sensitive applications we ship have an AppArmor profile which
disables spawning the Unsafe Browser (XXX: ensure this is true!).

This means that making the Unsafe Browser a setting in the Tails Greeter
doesn't actually improve security as of now: if the user doesn't want to use
Unsafe Browser, they just will avoid to, and no practical attacker can easily
run it.


#### accessibility bus

An attacker with access to the accessibility bus can trivially exploit an
_already-open_ Unsafe Browser to phone home and deanonymize users.

This is a serious attack surface, however:

 - this only applies to an already-open Unsafe Browser. This is strictly harder then the previous "enable
   Unsafe Browser" that Tails had on X.Org. In fact, the mere fact of having it *enabled* was enough to
   deanonymize you. Therefore, users who would have not enabled the Unsafe Browser before Tails 5.8, can now
   just avoid opening it.

 - For this attack to be possible at all, it's necessary that the user manually enabled accessibility
   features. Most applications cannot enable accessibility on their own. So for all users that don't have
   accessibility features enabled, this attack is unfeasible. We acknowledge that a11y is a feature which many
   users just can't disable.

XXX: check if the end-user doc clearly says that it's better to close the
Unsafe Browser as soon as you're done with what you needed to do.
