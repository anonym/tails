<h1 id="error-starting-gdm">Error starting GDM</h1>

This section applies if you see the following error message when
starting Tails:

<p class="pre">
Error starting GDM with your graphics card: <i>name of your graphics
card [id] (rev number)</i>. Please take note of this error and visit
https://tails.boum.org/gdm for troubleshooting.
</p>

[[!img error.png link="no" alt=""]]

1. Identify the name, ID, and revision number (if any) of your graphics card.

   For example, if your error message starts with:

   <p class="pre">Error starting GDM with your graphics card:
   NVIDIA Corporation [10de:0a6c] GT218M [NVS 3100M] (rev a2)</p>

   - The name is *NVIDIA Corporation GT218M [NVS 3100M]*.
   - The ID is *[10de:0a6c]*. The ID is unique to the model of your
     graphics card, it is not unique to your computer.
   - The revision number is *a2*. Your graphics card might have no
     revision number.

1. Check if your graphics card is listed below. For example, you can search for its
   name or ID on this page.

   - If your graphics card is listed, check if a workaround is
     documented to make it work on Tails.

     If the workaround doesn't work, we are sorry that Tails does not work well
     on this computer. Our best hope is that a future update of Linux drivers will
     solve the problem.

   - If your graphics card is not listed, please [[contact our support
     team by email|support/talk]].

     Mention in your email:

     - The version of Tails that you are trying to start.
     - The name, ID, and revision number (if any) of your graphics card.

     <div class="tip">

     <p>You can send us a photo of the error message as it appears on
     your screen.</p>

     </div>

1. If your problem gets fixed in a future version of Tails, please let us
   know so we can update this page.

<h2 id="radeon-hd">AMD Radeon HD</h2>

<!--
Issues: #11095 #12482
-->

### Affected graphics cards

Any graphics cards in the Radeon HD family might be affected.

### Workaround

If the computer has another, integrated graphics card, try configuring
the computer to use that one instead of the AMD graphics card.
For example, using the following [[boot
option|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]]:

* `modprobe.blacklist=amdgpu`
* `modprobe.blacklist=radeon`

<h2 id="radeon-r9">AMD Radeon R9</h2>

<!--

<tr><th>Name</th><th>ID</th><th>Revision number</th></tr>
<tr><td>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Hawaii PRO [Radeon R9 290/390]</td><td>[1002:67b1]</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

### Workaround

Adding `radeon.dpm=0` to the
[[boot options|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]]
might fix the issue.

<h2 id="amd-radeon-rx-400">AMD Radeon RX 400 family</h2>

### Affected graphics cards

<table>
<tr><th>Name</th><th>ID</th><th>Revision number</th></tr>
<tr><td>Radeon RX 480</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
</table>

### Workaround

Adding `amdgpu.dc=0` to the
[[boot options|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]]
might fix the issue.

### Other possibly affected graphics cards

Other graphics cards in the [[!wikipedia Radeon_RX_400_series]] might be affected.

<h2 id="amd-vega">AMD Radeon RX Vega family</h2>

### Affected graphics cards

Graphics cards in the [[!wikipedia Radeon_RX_Vega_series]],
as found in some AMD Ryzen processors, might be affected.

### Workaround

Try starting Tails using the following [[boot option|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]]:

    iommu=soft

<h2 id="intel">Intel</h2>

### Affected graphics cards

Various Intel graphics card, including but not limited to:

<table>
<tr><th>Name</th><th>ID</th><th>Revision number</th></tr>
<tr><td>Intel Corporation TigerLake-LP GT2 [Iris Xe Graphics]</td><td>[8086:9a49]</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Intel Corporation JasperLake [UHD Graphics]</td><td>[8086:4e55]</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Intel Corporation Iris Plus Graphics G1 (Ice Lake)</td><td>[8086:8a56]</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

### Workaround

Try starting Tails using the following [[boot
option|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]]:

        i915.force_probe=MODEL

… replacing *MODEL* with the 4 characters you see after `8086:`
on the error message.

For example, if you see an error about `8086:4c8a`, use this boot option:
`i915.force_probe=4c8a`.

<h2 id="multiple">Multiple graphics cards</h2>

If the error message lists multiple graphics cards:

* If possible, plug in the monitor into the motherboard's Intel graphics card, as
  opposed to the external Nvidia or AMD/ATI graphics card.

* Explicitly select one of the two graphics adapters in the BIOS
  instead of letting the system choose one automatically. If this does
  not solve the problem, try selecting the other graphics adapter.

* Try starting Tails using the following [[boot options|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]].
  You should try only one of these boot options per start attempt.

  - `modprobe.blacklist=nouveau`
  - `nouveau.modeset=0`

<h1 id="other-issues">Other issues</h1>

<h2 id="black-screen-switchable-graphics">Black screen with switchable graphics computers</h2>

Some computers with switchable graphics (such as Optimus) fail to
choose a video card and end up on a black screen. This has been
reported for MacBook Pro 6,2, MacBook Pro 10,1 Retina, MacBook Pro
15-inch (early 2011) and might affect many others.

There are several possible workarounds for this issue:

* Explicitly select one of the two graphics adapters in the BIOS
  instead of letting the system choose one automatically. If this does
  not solve the problem, try selecting the other graphics adapter.

* For the Mac computers, it is possible to use a third-party
  application, <http://gfx.io/>, to force integrated graphics only through macOS.
  Then restart in that special mode that works with Tails.

<h2 id="qemu">Virtual machines with <span class="application">virt-manager</span>, <span class="application">libvirt</span> and <span class="application">QEMU</span></h2>

See the
[[dedicated troubleshooting documentation|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/virt-manager#graphics-issues]]
about graphics issues in Tails running inside a virtual machine
with <span class="application">virt-manager</span>.

<h2 id="vmware">Virtual machines with <span class="application">VMware</span></h2>

To improve support of Tails running inside a virtual machine with
*VMware*, install the
`open-vm-tools-desktop` software package as [[Additional
Software|doc/persistent_storage/additional_software]] in Tails.

<h2 id="boot-options">Probing EDD error</h2>

Use these instructions if Tails failed to start and displayed the
following error:

        Probing EDD (edd=off to disable)...

1. Follow [[our guide for editing boot options|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]].

1. For the guide's "Modify the boot options as needed" step,
   type `edd=off` to add this option to the command line.

<h2 id="display-artifacts-intel">Display artifact when starting Tails on Intel display</h2>

If you see screen tearing and color artifact shift through display with an Intel graphics card,
try this:

1. Right-click on the desktop
2. Click *Display Settings*
3. Change the refresh rate to a different value.<br />
   For example, setting the refresh rate to 48 HZ fixed the problem on Tails 5.9
   with this hardware: Gemini Lake N4100 (Intel Graphics 600).
