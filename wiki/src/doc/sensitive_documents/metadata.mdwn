What is metadata?
=================

Metadata is "data about data" or "information about information" that is embedded
in computer files, usually automatically. Metadata is used to describe,
identify, categorize, and sort files.

However, metadata can also be used to deanonymize users and expose
private information.

Examples of metadata include:

- In image files:
  - the location where a photo was taken
  - the date and time a photo was taken
  - the model and serial number of the camera used to take a photo
- In text document files:
  - the author of the document
  - changes to the document

To learn more about how metadata can be used to identify and reveal personal information, see
[Behind the Data: Investigating metadata](https://exposingtheinvisible.org/en/guides/behind-the-data-metadata-investigations/).

<div class="caution">

<p>It is impossible to reliably find and remove all metadata in complex file
formats. For example, <i>Microsoft Office</i> documents can contain embedded images,
audio, and other files containing their own metadata that Tails cannot
remove.</p>

<p>You should remove metadata on any files before you embed them into another
document.</p>

<p>Also, you should save files in simpler formats whenever possible.
For example, instead of saving a text document as a .docx file,
you can save the document as a plain .txt file.</p>

Removing metadata using *Metadata Cleaner*
==========================================

Tails includes
[*Metadata Cleaner*](https://metadatacleaner.romainvigier.fr/)
so you can remove metadata from files before you publish or share them.

*Metadata Cleaner* works on many file formats, including:

- Image files, such as .jpeg, .png, and .gif
- *LibreOffice* files, such as .odt and .ods
- *Microsoft Office* documents, such as .docx, .xlsx, and .pptx
- Audio files, such as .mp3, .flac, and .ogg
- Video files, such as .mp4 and .avi
- Archive files, such as .zip and .tar

To open *Metadata Cleaner* choose **Applications**&nbsp;▸
**Accessories** &nbsp;▸ **Metadata Cleaner**.

Removing metadata from the *Files* browser
==========================================

You can also remove metadata directly from the *Files* browser:

1. Open the *Files* browser.

1. Navigate to the folder containing the files that you want to remove
   metadata from.

1. Select the files that you want to remove metadata from.

1. Right-click (on Mac, click with two fingers) on the files and choose
   **Remove metadata**.

<div class="note">

<p>Both techniques rely on the <a
href="https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2">mat2</a> toolkit to remove
metadata, so they work on the same file formats and remove the same
metadata.</p>
