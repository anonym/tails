We recommend you to create another Tails to store
your backup. This way, if your Tails is lost or damaged, you can
replace it immediately with your backup Tails.

1. When starting Tails, unlock your Persistent Storage.

1. Plug in the new USB stick on which you want to create your backup Tails USB
   stick.

1. Choose **Applications**&nbsp;▸ **Tails Installer**.

1. Turn on the option **Clone the current Persistent Storage** below the
   option **Clone the current Tails**.

1. Make sure that the new USB stick is selected in the **Target USB stick**
   menu.

1. To start the cloning, click on the **Install** button.

1. Enter a passphrase for the Persistent Storage on the new USB stick in the
   **Passphrase** text box.

1. Enter the same passphrase again in the **Confirm** text box.

1. Click **Continue**.

1. Read the warning message in the confirmation dialog.

1. Click **Delete All Data and Install** to confirm.

   Cloning takes a few minutes.

   <div class="note">

   <p>Each time you update your backup, only the files that have changed
   are copied.</p>

   </div>

1. If your backup Tails has an outdated version of Tails, we recommend you upgrade it by cloning your
   current Tails using <span class="application">Tails Installer</span>.
   For detailed instructions, see how to [[manually upgrade from another
   Tails|upgrade/clone#upgrade]].

Updating your backup Tails from a terminal
==========================================

If you prefer updating your backup Tails from a terminal:

1. When starting Tails, unlock your Persistent Storage and [[set up an administration
   password|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password]].

1. Choose **Applications**&nbsp;▸ **Accessories**&nbsp;▸ **Files** to open the
   *Files* browser.

1. Plug in your backup Tails USB stick.

   A new encrypted volume appears in the sidebar of the
   *Files* browser. Click on it and enter the
   passphrase of your backup Tails to unlock the volume.

1. Execute the following command in a *Root Terminal*:

       rsync -PaSHAXv --del /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/ /media/amnesia/TailsData

   When the command finishes, it displays a summary of the data that was
   copied. For example:

       sent 32.32M bytes  received 1.69K bytes  21.55M bytes/sec
       total size is 32.30M  speedup is 1.00
