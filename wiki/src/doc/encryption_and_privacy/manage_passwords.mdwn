[[!meta title="Managing passwords using KeePassXC"]]

Using the [<span class="application">KeePassXC</span>](https://keepassxc.org/)
password manager you can:

  - Store many passwords in an encrypted database which is protected by
    a single passphrase of your choice.
  - Always use different and stronger passwords, since you only have to
    remember a single passphrase to unlock the entire database.
  - Generate very strong random passwords.

Creating and saving a password database
=======================================

Follow these steps to create a new password database and save it in the
Persistent Storage for use in future working sessions.

To learn how to create a Persistent Storage, read our
[[documentation on the Persistent Storage|persistent_storage]].

0. When starting Tails, unlock the Persistent Storage.

0. In Tails, choose **Applications**&nbsp;▸ **Persistent Storage**.

0. Verify that the Persistent Folder feature is turned on.

0. To start <span class="application">KeePassXC</span>, choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
   <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guisubmenu">Accessories</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guimenuitem">KeePassXC</span></span>.

0. To create a new database, click <span class="guilabel">Create new database</span>.

0. Continue with the defaults settings in the configuration screens **General
   Database Information** and **Encryption Settings**.

0. The database is encrypted and protected by
   a passphrase. In the configuration screen **Database Credentials**:

   * Specify a passphrase of your choice in the **Enter password** text box.
   * Type the same passphrase again in the **Confirm password** text box.
   * Click **Done**.

0. Save the database as *Passwords.kdbx* in the *Persistent* folder.

Restoring and unlocking the password database
=============================================

Follow these steps to unlock the password database saved in the
Persistent Storage from a previous working session.

0. When starting Tails, unlock the Persistent Storage.

0. In Tails, choose **Applications**&nbsp;▸ **Accessories**&nbsp;▸
   **KeePassXC**.

0. If you have a database named *Passwords.kdbx* in your *Persistent* folder,
   <span class="application">KeePassXC</span> automatically displays a dialog to
   unlock that database.

   Enter the passphrase for this database and click <span class="guilabel">OK</span>.

0. If you enter a wrong passphrase the following error message
   appears:

   <span class="guilabel">Error while reading the database: Invalid credentials
   were provided, please try again.</span>

<div class="bug">

<p>The auto-type feature of <i>KeePassXC</i> is broken for most applications
since Tails 5.8 (December 2021).</p>

</div>

Storing your *KeePassXC* settings in the Persistent Storage
===========================================================

To store your *KeePassXC* settings in the Persistent Storage,
in addition to the password database:

1. Turn on the [[Dotfiles|persistent_storage/configure#dotfiles]]
   feature of the Persistent Storage.

1. Restart Tails.

1. In the Welcome Screen, unlock the Persistent Storage.

1. In Tails, choose **Places**&nbsp;▸ **Dotfiles**.

1. Create the folder */live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles/.config/keepassxc/*.

1. Copy the file *~/.config/keepassxc/keepassxc.ini* to
   */live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles/.config/keepassxc/keepassxc.ini*.
