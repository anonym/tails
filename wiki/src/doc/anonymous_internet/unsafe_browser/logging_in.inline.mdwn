To sign in to a network using a captive portal:

1. Try visiting an innocent-looking website that is common in your
   location, for example, a search engine or news site:

   - <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
   - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a>
   - <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank"/>DuckDuckGo</a>

1. If you are redirected to a captive portal, sign in to the network.

   If you are not redirected to a captive portal and the website loads,
   this means that you are already connected to the Internet. Close
   <span class="warning">this browser</span>
   <span class="doc">the <i>Unsafe Browser</i></span>
   and try connecting to the Tor network again.

   <!-- Clarify this after #18382 and #5785. -->

1. After Tor is ready, close
   <span class="warning">this browser.</span>
   <span class="doc">the <i>Unsafe Browser</i>.</span>

   You can use *Tor Browser* or any other application as usual.
